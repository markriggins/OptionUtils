  Architecture
  1. Rename GitHub OptionUtils to SpreadFinder
  2. Cleanup GS permissions, no more access to the drive
  See, edit, create, and delete all your Google Sheets spreadsheets. Learn more
  3. Learn why you're not seeing links to SpreadFinder's Privacy Policy or Terms of Service
  4. Find out why, on a fresh copy it thinks TSLA is 826 shares and	$480.00
  5. Stop expecting TransactionDate to be in option csv files , when its Last Trade or  Time
  6. Make option prices TransactionDate into TxnDateTime
  10. Be sure that the DATA/OptionPrices support the sample portfolio.  Put "sample" in their name, so they will be ignored later
